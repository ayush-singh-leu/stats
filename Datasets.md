Flight price dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sakshiidewangan/flight-price-dataset
I have selected this dataset because I previously used to work with a Company that used to deal with dynamic pricing for short term rental (Airbnb, VRBO, Booking.com). Now I would like to apply my experience to a different domain that also works with dynamic pricing based on certain factors that I wish to explore.

This dataset is of my personal interest as it not only deals with F1(which I sometimes enjoy) but also related to Sport Data Analytics. It is my dream to work as a Data Analyst/ Scientist for a Sports team. PLaying around with this dataset should be very informative in that context.
